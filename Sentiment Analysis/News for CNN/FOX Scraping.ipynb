Nikki Haley accuses WHO of taking &aposChina&aposs word&apos on coronavirus transmission Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\xa0and a\\xa0face of President Trump&aposs Coronavirus Task Force, said last Thursday he didn’t understand why a federal stay-at-home order hadn&apost been put in place. But Haley countered: “America is better served when presidents respect the diversity of states instead of dictating uniform solutions.\" She said governors know their residents and their state’s needs better than the federal government does, and are in the best position to oversee efforts taken within the state.
